# The BREQN source

This directory contains Michael Downes' original source for breqn.

The Perl script `lls2dtx.pl` was written by Lars Madsen to translate Michael's experimental source syntax into more standard LaTeX Docstrip.

Since the conversion the sources have diverged and their presence here is for historical significance.
