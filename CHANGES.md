# Release notes for the `breqn` packages

## v0.98f (2018/09/14)

  * Insert `\nolinenumbers` inside maths environments if the `lineno` package is loaded.
    It would be better to insert a line number, but at least with this the document still compiles!


## v0.98e (2017/01/27)

  * Fix in `\mathchoice` to allow use under recent versions of LuaTeX
